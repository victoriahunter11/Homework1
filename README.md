# Homework1


In this homework, I worked on refactoring the HTML and CSS to make sure it was in semantic code. This required getting rid of some "divs" where deemed not necessary. I tried to refactor the code to ensure that each tag and element had a purpose. I also added comments to help those viewing the code know what each part contained.
